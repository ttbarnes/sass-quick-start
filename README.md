Sass quick start
================

Quick start sass to css compilation with grunt or gulp. 

Kick start your project, idea or proof of concept with minimal sass/grunt/gulp configuration.

##Getting started
1) `npm install`

2) `grunt`, `gulp` or `gulp watch`

##What's included

##Why?
I found myself frequently setting up grunt or gulp purely to start compiling sass. This makes it easier.
